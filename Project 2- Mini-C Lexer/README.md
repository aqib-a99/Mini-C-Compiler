1. Change current working directory to that of the unzipped folder. 
2. Since Parser and Lexer files are ready to be executed using java command, simply run the following :
				java Program testcase.minc > output.txt
				
		, where testcase.minc is your input file, stored in the same working directory,
		and output.txt is the file in which the output of the lexer will be stored in text.
